    "# Project 2 - Substitution matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past project we've made extensive use of Soring systems in order to achieve sequence alignment. The scores assigned to each amino acid pair were not understood, we simply used standard ones. The scoring systems we used are called **substitution matrices** as they provide scores for each possible amino acid substitution. When comparing two sequences, one of the following is true:\n",
    "* **Evolutionary model**: sequences B and A do not have a common origin. Therefore B can be seen as completely random when compared to A. This does not mean B has to be completely different than A : amino acids $a$ and $b$ could still align by chance. We can calculate the probability of that happening by looking at the amino acid frequencies $p_a$ and $p_b$ in the population.\n",
    "$$Prob(a, b) = p_a \\cdot p_b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random model**: sequences B and A have a common origin. Therefore B is not random, and a good alignment between A and B will provide us with the result of each of their mutations. The probability of amino acids $a$ and $b$ being aligned depends on the likelihood of substitutions from $a$ to $b$ or $b$ to $a$.\n",
    "$$Prob(a, b) = q_{a,b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to be able to tell these cases apart. In order to do that, we'll construct substitution matrices, assigning to each amino acid pair a score equal to the **log-odds ratio** $\\frac{q_{a,b}}{p_a \\cdot p_b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BLOCKS\n",
    "\n",
    "`BLOCKS` is a database of amino acid sequences. It was used to construct the standard BLOSUM matrices. We used it to retrieve two families of sequences : the SH3 and PDZ domains. These come in multiple \"blocks\" of gapless aligned sequences of the same size. We quickly formatted these informations into .fasta files compatible with our previous project. With them, we'll be able to construct our own BLOSUM matrices specific to these domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BLOSUM\n",
    "\n",
    "`BLOSUM` or BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix uses the well-conserved (gapless and aligned) sequences found in `BLOCKS` to determine the numerical values of $p_a$, $p_b$ and $q_{a,b}$, based on the required identity between them. For example, `BLOSUM 62` is the `BLOSUM` that was calculated for a required identity of 62%. Here's an overview of the algorithm for calculating the log-odds ratios with an identity of $X$% :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate all sequences into $t$ groups $G_{i}$, such that all sequences $s_{j} \\in G_{i}$ in each group have at least $X$ percent identity with some other sequence of the same group. We assume the sequences have she same lenght $n$."
